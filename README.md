PROJECT TITLE: LEAN SUPPLY CHAINS

DESCRIPTION: For decades, manufacturing engineers have leveraged the techniques of LEAN philosophies to streamline their processes and eliminate wastes from operations. Recently, professionals have magnified the usefulness of LEAN tools to not only the manufacturing world but to non-traditional processes as well. Supply Chain Management is ultimately a compilation of processes that can be viewed from a LEAN approach. This project will report how firms have begun to apply LEAN principles to supply chain designs and why this type of thinking is pivotal in the ever-increasing competitive market that companies of today are exposed to.
